Flowery's notes for session 14: 

--- E V E N T S ---
 
 • Events are all the actions that activated by the user in our document or interface

 • Listener: is an element that is awaiting to receive an event and executes a function as a response to that event.

 • Callback: is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.

Will be adding more notes later on.
